Description: Functions for testing randomness for a univariate time series with arbitrary distribution  (discrete, continuous, mixture of both types) and for testing  independence between random variables with arbitrary distributions. The test statistics are based on the multilinear empirical copula and multipliers are used to compute P-values. The test of independence between random variables appeared in <doi:10.1093/biomet/asy059>.
